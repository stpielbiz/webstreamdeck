- Native Fire TV app lives in `native-app/android/` (Kotlin WebView + Media3 player, JS bridge `window.StreamDeckNative`) and is built by `.github/workflows/android.yml` — providers block server/browser playback, so device-side playback is required.
- Movies and Shows use one shared workspace across TV and web: saved system genres stay visible beside an upper player and tiles, while Shows reveal seasons and episodes inline — this keeps Firestick browsing predictable without provider category labels.
- Device pairing uses the public `/device-login` entry screen and returns there after authentication; legacy Firestick and TV-specific links redirect to it.
